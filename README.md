# Track League of Legends Chest Availability

## Requirements
* A Riot API key (https://developer.riotgames.com)
* Install jq to parse json data from RIOT (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Setup
* git clone https://github.com/jetong/lol_chest_tracker.git
* in lol_chest_tracker directory, create file .api_key.txt with your Riot API key inside

## Usage
* Run add_summoner.sh with supplied arguments:
```
./add_summoner.sh summoner_name days hours minutes chests_available
```
where days, hours, and minutes is the amount of time until the next available chest (if hours and minutes are not known, use 0 as the value)

  Example using summoner name faker, 4 days until next available chest, and 2 chests currently available: 
```  
./add_summoner.sh faker 4 0 0 2
```

* After summoners have been added, simply run ./run.sh (ideally as an hourly cron job) to update lol_data.txt.
```
./run.sh
```
* View lol_data.txt for chest availability of each summoner tracked.

Listed in the following format, where the last data value is the number of chests available. [(see sample)](https://github.com/jetong/lol_chest_tracker/blob/master/lol_data.txt)
```
name:id:days:hours:minutes:timestamp:total_chests:chests_available
```
